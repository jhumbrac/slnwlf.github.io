    <h2>More about Dave</h2>
    <p>I'm passionate about building start-ups and designing frictionless product experiences.    I've held senior product management roles at a variety of web startups.  Depending on the stage of the company I've contributed as co-founder, head of product, product management consultant or advisor.  Specific skills include user experience design, market research, usability testing and content marketing.   Recently I've headed up product teams in mobile, enterprise applications and e-commerce.<br /><b />
	Next, I want to build my software development skills at General Assembly so at my next startup I can build prototypes and product myself!
